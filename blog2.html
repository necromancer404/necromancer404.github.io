      <h1>Fading Strands: Exploring the Journey of Hair Resilience</h1>
      <h7><br>Wednesday 6 December -Hamza<br><br><br></h7>
      <p1> 
          One of life's significant challenges is grappling with hair loss, a concern often downplayed by those who haven't experienced it firsthand.
Picture approaching the pinnacle of your life, burdened by the weight of hair loss and the accompanying stress.
Moving to a new city to join college or start a new job can be stressful,and in this stressful sitaution, hairloss is imminent.
Also since you are moving to a whole new area, water changes.
        <br><br>
You’ve probably heard the terms “hard water” and “soft water.” You may wonder what determines the hardness or softness of water, although water is typically crystal clear, it contains minerals and chemicals. The concentration of certain minerals is what creates the “hardness” of water.
        <br><br>
When I first moved to college, in about 3 weeks I started to face this horror.
I was devasted, I love my hair and have always taken great care of it. So you can imagine what I went through.
          I couldnt find the root cause of this, I had used <a class="soft" href="https://amzn.eu/d/hHYKEb3" target = "_blank">water softening liquids</a>, so water wasnt an issue. I read through a ton of blogs, subreddits, doctor's advices and narrowed it down to this:
        <br><br>
Things that cause hairloss: 
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> hard water</li>
          <li> unbalanced diet</li>
          <li>excessive sweating and warmer climate</li>
          <li>stress</li>
          <li>dehydration</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
It was time to fight back.
        <br>
I stopped using water softening liquids, because well, they are chemicals and there is no way to know  how effective they are, instead I started using drinking water to wash my hair, I have very long hair(my parents say so) and it takes me only about 3 litres to wash my hair throughly.
          I started drinking a lot of water, like 4-5 litres in 2-3 classes worth of time and I changed my shampoo, well changed isnt the right word for it as I have used random shampoos my whole life. But yeah I started using <a class="khadi" href="https://amzn.eu/d/383okAu" target="_blank" >khadi's </a> shampoo which I didnt use a lot, I only washed my hair once a week with shampoo.<br><br>
          Also I started applying <a class="oil" href="https://amzn.eu/d/gK0cjn9" target="_blank" >this </a> the night before washing my hair.<br>
        <p2>
instructions for it : mix about 5 drops of it with water in its cap and apply to scalp.(do a patch test first)
        </p2>
        <br>
        <br>
In 2 weeks I could see that all my efforts were'nt in vain.
Thank god, I saw improvement . 
Caressing through my hair didnt leave 2-3 strands in my hand.
I started feeling better.
Relieved even.
Stress started to diminish and so did my hairloss.
        <br>
        <br>
          It lead me to this conclusion:<br><br>
Stress exponentially increses hairloss, even if you are not suffering from the horrors of hairloss, and you start to stress about it for whatever reasons , it will happen to you.
 People even start counting the number of strands they've lost on the floor(definetly not me).
Most effective way to reduce stress of hairloss is to stress about something else (take healthy stress) or occupy yourself, dont let yourself be alone with your thoughts.
        <br><br>If you feel your condition is worse, consider talking to a dermatologist, just remember losing 100-150 strands in one day is normal.
