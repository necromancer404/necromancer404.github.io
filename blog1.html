      <h1>The concept of Minimalism</h1>
      <h7><br>Saturday 2 December -Hamza<br><br><br></h7>
      <p1>
        In a world filled with constant noise, distractions, and an overwhelming array of choices, minimalism has emerged as a refreshing antidote. With so many distractions around us, we often find it challenging to create time and space to enjoy the simple things in life, like spending time with our loved ones, exercising, getting creative, cooking, or just doing nothing. “More” is what we’re up against as a society. We often associate more with status, security, comfort and control. But the more you externally desire, the further you get away from yourself, and the more you have to lose.<br><br>
          Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.<br><br>
          That doesn’t mean there’s anything inherently wrong with owning material possessions. Today’s problem seems to be the meaning we assign to stuff: we assign too much meaning to things, often forsaking our health, our relationships, our passions, our personal growth, and our desire to contribute beyond ourselves.<br><br>

          Instead of thinking more will make you feel better, minimalism helps you to go small instead.<br><br>

          When you’re small, you can go deep with what you already have.<br><br>
          When you’re small, you’re more nimble, agile and responsive to change.<br><br>

          When you’re small, you have fewer responsibilities and commitments, which frees you up to have richer experiences with less pressure.<br><br>

          When you’re small, you’re limited by constraints, creating opportunities to innovate and have breakthroughs.<br><br>

          When you’re small, you can take more risks.<br><br>

Small is beautiful.
